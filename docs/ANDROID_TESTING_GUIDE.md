# Testing Android In-App Purchases: Complete Guide

This guide covers testing Android in-app purchases using Google Play Console and various testing methods.

## Recommended Testing Method: License Testing

**License Testing** is the best approach for Android IAP development:

- **No app uploads** - Test with debug builds directly
- **Multiple test scenarios** - Various payment responses
- **Fast iteration** - No review process delays  
- **Free testing** - No charges for test purchases
- **Real billing flow** - Simulates actual Google Play integration

**Play Billing Lab** (optional advanced testing):
- Download: [Play Billing Lab](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.play.billingtestcompanion)
- Test different regions and payment methods
- Must be a license tester to access

## Prerequisites

- **Google Play paid developer account** ($25 one-time fee)
- **App already released in Google Play Console** 
- **Billing permission** in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
  ```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />
  ```

## Product Configuration

1. **Navigate to Monetize ‚Üí Products**
2. **Create In-App Products**
   - Product ID (must match your code)
   - Title and description
   - Price in your default currency
   - Activate the product

## License Testing Setup

### Step 1: Configure License Testers

1. **Go to Setup ‚Üí License testing** in Play Console
2. **Add Gmail accounts** under "License testers" section
   - Enter email addresses (one per line)
   - Must be valid Gmail accounts
   - Testers will receive email invitation

3. **Configure test responses:**
   - **PURCHASED** - Simulates successful purchase
   - **CANCELED** - Simulates user cancellation  
   - **UNAVAILABLE** - Simulates product unavailable
   - **ITEM_ALREADY_OWNED** - Simulates already purchased

**License Tester Benefits:**
- Can sideload debug builds without uploading to Play Store
- Bypass Google Play signature verification
- Test with various payment methods including test instruments
- No real charges for test purchases

### Step 2: Test with License Accounts

1. **Sign in** to test device with license testing account
2. **Install app** (can be debug build or sideloaded APK)
3. **Available test instruments:**
   - Test card (always approves)
   - Test card (always declines) 
   - Slow test card (approves after few minutes)
   - Slow test card (declines after few minutes)
4. **Test purchases** - responses will be simulated based on your configuration
5. **No real transactions** are processed

**Testing Benefits:**
- Works with debug builds and custom signatures
- No need to upload to Play Store for each test
- Test various payment scenarios with test instruments
- Ideal for automated testing flows

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: License testing uses simulated responses, so it's good for testing purchase flow but not for validating real Google Play integration.

## Play Billing Lab Testing (Optional)

### Setup Play Billing Lab

1. **Download from Play Store:** [Play Billing Lab](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.play.billingtestcompanion)
   - Only accessible to license testers
2. **Sign in** with your license tester account  
3. **Configure testing settings:**
   - Select test country/region
   - Enable real payment methods (requires permissions)
   - Apply configuration changes

### Regional Testing

1. **Select desired country** in Play Billing Lab
2. **Apply changes** and restart your app
3. **Test purchase flow** in selected region
4. **Verify pricing** and currency display

**Alternative without Play Billing Lab:**
- Create Gmail account in target country
- Use VPN to desired region
- Clear Play Store data/cache between tests

### Real Payment Method Testing

**Note:** Requires special permissions from Google Play Business Development.

1. **Enable real payment methods** in Play Billing Lab
2. **Test with actual payment instruments**
3. **Request refunds** for test purchases to avoid charges

## Testing Scenarios

### Basic Purchase Testing

1. **Load products** using your product IDs
2. **Initiate purchase** for each product type
3. **Handle purchase result**:
   - Success ‚Üí Acknowledge purchase
   - Pending ‚Üí Wait for completion
   - Error ‚Üí Handle gracefully

### Pending Transaction Testing

Test pending transactions using license testers with slow test cards:

1. **Test declining payment:**
   - Use "Slow test card, declines after a few minutes"
   - Purchase should show as `PENDING` initially
   - After few minutes, purchase fails
   - Verify app handles failure gracefully

2. **Test approving payment:**
   - Use "Slow test card, approves after a few minutes" 
   - Purchase shows as `PENDING` initially
   - After few minutes, purchase becomes `PURCHASED`
   - Verify app grants access when state changes

### Acknowledgment Testing

**CRITICAL**: All purchases must be acknowledged within 3 days or they will be automatically refunded.

```typescript
// Example acknowledgment
import { NativePurchases } from '@capgo/native-purchases';

try {
  const purchases = await NativePurchases.queryPurchases();
  
  for (const purchase of purchases.purchases) {
    if (purchase.purchaseState === 'PURCHASED' && !purchase.acknowledged) {
      await NativePurchases.acknowledgePurchase({
        purchaseToken: purchase.purchaseToken
      });
    }
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Acknowledgment failed:', error);
}
```

## Testing Tools and Debugging

### 1. Google Play Console Testing Tools

- **Order management** - View all test transactions
- **Financial reports** - Analyze test transaction data



### 2. Android Debug Logging

Add comprehensive logging to track purchase flow:

```typescript
console.log('üîç Querying products:', productIds);
console.log('üì¶ Products found:', products.length);
console.log('üí≥ Launching purchase for:', productId);
console.log('‚úÖ Purchase successful:', purchase.orderId);
```

### 3. Testing Checklist

- **Purchase on Device A** ‚Üí Verify on Device B
- **Purchase status sync** across devices
- **Offline purchase** ‚Üí Sync when online

### 2. Already Owned Products

Test scenarios where user already owns a product:
- **Attempt to purchase again** ‚Üí Should show "already owned"
- **Restore purchases** ‚Üí Verify owned status

## Google Play Product Display Guidelines

### üìã Recommended Practices

While Google Play is less strict than Apple, following these practices improves user experience and compliance:

### Best Practices for Product Display

1. **Use Real Product Data**
   ```typescript
   // Recommended: Use actual product details
   product.title                         // Product name from Play Console
   product.priceString               // Formatted price
   product.description                  // Product description
   ```

2. **Handle Localization**
   ```typescript
   // Google Play handles currency conversion automatically
   const price = product.priceString;
   // Displays as "$9.99", "‚Ç¨8.99", "¬•1000", etc. based on user's region
   ```

3. **Dynamic Content Benefits**
   - **Automatic currency conversion** for international users
   - **Tax inclusion** where required by local law  
   - **Promotional pricing** updates automatically
   - **A/B testing** price changes through Play Console

### ‚ùå Not Recommended

```typescript
// Avoid hardcoded values
<div>Premium Plan - $9.99</div>  // Static price
```

### ‚úÖ Recommended

```typescript
// Use dynamic product data
<div>{product.title} - {product.priceString}</div>
```

### Testing Product Display

- [ ] **Prices** show in correct local currency
- [ ] **Names** match Play Console configuration
- [ ] **Descriptions** display properly
- [ ] **Special offers** appear when configured

> üí° **Note**: Unlike iOS, Google Play won't reject apps for hardcoded prices, but using dynamic data provides better user experience and international support.

## Security and Validation

### 1. Server-Side Verification

Always verify purchases on your server:

```typescript
// Send purchase token to your server for verification
const purchaseData = {
  purchaseToken: purchase.purchaseToken,
  productId: purchase.productId,
  orderId: purchase.orderId
};

// POST to your verification endpoint
await fetch('/api/verify-purchase', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(purchaseData)
});
```

### 2. Local Verification

Verify purchase signature locally:

```typescript
import { NativePurchases } from '@capgo/native-purchases';

async function verifyPurchase(purchase: any): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    // Verification is handled by the native layer
    // Just check if purchase is valid
    return purchase.purchaseState === 'PURCHASED' && 
           purchase.purchaseToken && 
           purchase.signature;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Verification failed:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

## Best Practices
